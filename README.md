# OneShotLearning with Siamese neural networks

## Building
In order to run all the files successfully you need to install the following libraries:
- numpy 
- matplotlib
- keras
- sklearn
- mnist

## ! IMPORTANT !
First of all you need to download the mnist dataset [http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/]
and rename downloaded files as follows:
- t10k-images-idx3-ubyte
- t10k-labels-idx1-ubyte
- train-images-idx3-ubyte
- train-labels-idx1-ubyte

Then put all this files in /generate_dataframe/data

## Full tutorial is given in [Tutorial.ipynb](https://github.com/dimafurs1337/OneShotLearning/blob/master/Tutorial.ipynb)

## To install jupyter notebook follow steps (write in command line):
- python -m pip install jupyter
